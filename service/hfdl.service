# Systemd unit to decode aircraft HF data link
# Phil Karn, KA9Q April 2025
# this is the per-channel version (note no '@' in hfdl.service)
# The radiod config file sets up one receiver channel per HFDL data channel
# All come out on the same multicast group with different SSRCs.
# This service file causes a single instance of 'pcmrecord --exec' to execute a separate instance of dumphfdl for each data channel, and demux the SSRCs to them

# Configuration is simpler because the radiod channels all have the same bandwidth and sample rate, and they only have to be specified in the radiod config file;
# the channel frequencies are automatically passed to dumphfdl through the $k variable so only one other config file are needed (/etc/radio/hfdl.conf)

# I'm interested in user comments from those who've tried both versions. Which should I keep?
